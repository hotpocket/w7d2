Writing Effective Test Cases

Objective:

Write effective test cases to thoroughly test the functionality of the "calculate_average_grade" function in Python.

 

Instructions:

This function takes a list of integer grades as input and returns the average grade calculated from the input grades. If the input list is empty, the function returns 0.0. Otherwise, it calculates the total sum of grades and divides it by the number of grades to determine the average.

 

1. Select the Function: Choose the "calculate_average_grade" function, which calculates the average grade based on a list of individual grades. The function signature is as follows:

Function in Python:

The function `calculate_average_grade` takes an array of numeric grades as input and returns the average grade calculated from the input grades. If the input array is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the total sum of grades using the `reduce` method and divides it by the length of the array to determine the average.

Equivalent function in JavaScript:

This JavaScript function `calculateAverageGrade` takes an array of numeric grades as input and returns the average grade calculated from the input grades. If the input array is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the total sum of grades using the `reduce` method and divides it by the length of the array to determine the average.

 

Write Test Cases: Develop at least three test cases to test the "calculate_average_grade" function thoroughly. Consider scenarios such as:
 

   - Case 1: Test with a list of positive integer grades.

   - Case 2: Test with a list of negative integer grades.

   - Case 3: Test with an empty list of grades.

 

Test Case Criteria: Each test case should include:
 

   - Description of the scenario being tested.

   - Input values or parameters for the "calculate_average_grade" function.

   - Expected output (average grade) based on the input.

   - Any assumptions or constraints related to the test scenario.

 

Testing Framework: Use the `unittest` framework in Python to implement and execute your test cases. Define a test class with separate methods for each test case, ensuring clear separation and organization of tests.
 

Documentation: Document your test cases in a README file, providing explanations for each scenario and the expected outcomes. Include any additional information or insights gained from writing and executing the test cases.
 

Submission: Compile your test cases and documentation into a single README file. Ensure that your submission is well-organized and easy to follow.
